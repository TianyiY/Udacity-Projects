    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. Decision tree:\n",
    "Application: Decision tree is one of the most widely used classification and prediction tools in data mining and machine learning. One widely industry application of this technology is the detection of Fraudulent Financial Statements (FFS). Creating a decision tree is a possible way to address this issue as it can consider all variables during the model development process. Kirkos et al. (2007) have created a decision tree model to identify and detect FFS. In their study, 76 Greek manufacturing firms have been selected and their published financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements, have been collected for modeling purposes. The created tree model shows that all non-fraud cases and 92% of the fraud cases have been correctly classified. Such a finding indicates that decision trees can make a significant contribution for the detection of FFS due to a highly accurate rate.\n",
    "Ref:http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/\n",
    "Pros: It is easy to understand and interpretable, it can easily handle qualitative (categorical) features, it works well if decision boundaries parellel to the feature axis. \n",
    "Cons: Only axis-aligned splits of data, it is not very stable if the dataset is perturbed a bit, it is prone to overfitting, the more decisions there are in a tree, the less accurate any expected outcomes are likely to be.\n",
    "Reason to select: This is a typical classificaiton problem, a decision tree can classify data and make effective predictions. It has the capability to discover hidden relationships between variables on the basis of its hierarchical structure.\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machine:\n",
    "Application: Classification of images can be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true of image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik. Hand-written characters can also be well recognized using SVM. \n",
    "Ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine\n",
    "Pros: It handle high dimensional data well, it performs well with both linear and non-linear boundary depending on the kernel used.\n",
    "Cons: Susceptible to overfitting/training issues depending on kernel, hard to choose kernel.\n",
    "Reason to select: SVM can be used for both classification and regression, it scales relatively well to high dimensional data by introducing the kernel trick.\n",
    "3. Ensemble Methods (Random Forest):\n",
    "Application: A random forest (RF) classifier is an ensemble classifier that produces multiple decision trees, using a randomly selected subset of training samples and variables. This classifier has become popular within the remote sensing community due to the accuracy of its classifications. RF classifier has been tested as a feature space optimization technique with satisfactory results in numerous applications such as the mapping of tree species, invasive plants, grass species, and insect defoliation levels in mopane woodland. \n",
    "Ref:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.01.011\n",
    "Pros: It is of relative low variance and high accuracy, it contains decorrelates trees.\n",
    "Cons: Not easy to visually interpret, heavy computational resources required.\n",
    "Reason to select: RF can be used for classification, it usually has good performance when dealing with multi feature classifications."

    "**Answer: ** The final model chosen is Random forest model(RF).\n",
    "The random forest is a typical ensemble approach, whose principle is that a group of “weak learners” can come together to form a “strong learner”. In RF model, the \"weak learners\" are decision trees. In a decision tree, an input is entered at the top and as it traverses down the tree the data gets bucketed into smaller and smaller sets. Random Forest grows many decision trees. To classify a new object from an input vector, put the input vector down each of the trees in the forest. Each tree gives a classification, and the tree \"votes\" for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest). Single decision trees often have high variance or high bias. Random Forests attempts to mitigate the problems of high variance and high bias by averaging to find a natural balance between the two extremes, so it handles the problem of overfitting very well. "

It coincides with my prediction in Q6, the only difference is the missing of marital-status in my prediction in Q6. Instead of marital-status, I think occupation has a higher degree of influence on income, this missing prediction may be largely due to the division of the categoty 'occupation' (it has been divided into several columns).

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
